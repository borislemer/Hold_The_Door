# Malicious IP lists (fragments)

Plain-text IP lists, one IPv4 per line. Generated by `pull_malicious_ips.py` from:

- **blocklist.de** – https://www.blocklist.de/downloads/export-ips_all.txt  
- **firehol** – https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets (all `.ipset` files)  
- **bitwire** – https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwire-it/ipblocklist/master/inbound.txt  

Each source is deduplicated and split into fragments of up to 9,999 IPs.  
Filenames: `{source}_{fragment}.txt` (e.g. `blocklist_de_001.txt`, `firehol_002.txt`).

Raw URLs (once pushed):

# Malicious IP lists (fragments)

Generated by `pull_malicious_ips.py` from:

- **blocklist.de** – https://www.blocklist.de/downloads/export-ips_all.txt  
- **firehol** – https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets (all `.ipset` files)  
- **bitwire** – https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwire-it/ipblocklist/master/inbound.txt  
- **cybercrime** – abuse.ch Feodo Tracker, cybercrime-tracker.net (fuckerz.php), firehol cybercrime.ipset  

## Per-source IP lists

Plain text, one IPv4 per line. Each source is deduplicated and split into fragments of up to 9,999 IPs.  
Filenames: `{source}_{fragment}.txt` (e.g. `blocklist_de_001.txt`, `firehol_002.txt`).

## Combined ranges (CIDR)

**`ranges_001.txt`, `ranges_002.txt`, …** – All unique IPs from every source are merged into the **minimal set of CIDR ranges** that cover them. Use these to limit list size (fewer entries than individual IPs) while still blocking the same addresses. One CIDR per line (e.g. `1.2.3.0/24`), up to 9,999 ranges per file.
